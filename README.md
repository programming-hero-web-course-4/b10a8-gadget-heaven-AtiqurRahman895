## 🧰 React Fundamental Concepts Used in This Project

- **Component-based Architecture**: The project is organized into reusable, modular components.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for local component states and Context API for global states like cart and wishlist.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: `useEffect` is used for dynamic updates such as setting page titles and filtered data.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components and UI elements adjust based on user actions, such as enabling/disabling buttons and displaying cart/wishlist items.
- **React Router**: Manages routing between pages and handles dynamic URL parameters for individual product details.

## 🛠️ Data Handling and Management

- **Context API**: Used to handle global state across the app for managing the Cart, Wishlist, Orders, and Order History. This ensures easy access to and manipulation of these data sets across components.
